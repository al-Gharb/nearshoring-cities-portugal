## Secondary cities spotlight (Coimbra, Covilhã)

### Coimbra (practical office-hub notes)
- **Anchor hub:** IPN Incubadora remains the main institutional anchor for tech-oriented company support in Coimbra.
- **Office-hub implication:** For teams wanting university/innovation proximity, IPN is the strongest validated option; complementary private cowork supply exists but is less consistently documented in official pages.
- **Practical caution:** Published public metrics on desk/office counts are not clearly exposed on the core incubation page; capacity should be confirmed directly before planning.
- Sources: https://www.ipn.pt/incubadora ; https://www.ipn.pt/noticias/noticia/2639?uri=%2F&a=2639

### Covilhã (practical office-hub notes)
- **limited inventory:** Market appears thinner than larger secondary/coastal cities; Parkurbis is the principal verified hub.
- **Anchor hub:** Parkurbis is the operationally relevant tech-park node; government/municipal pages corroborate its role and location.
- **Office-hub implication:** Companies needing larger commercial cowork ecosystems may face fewer immediate alternatives and should validate pipeline/availability directly with Parkurbis.

## Data gaps & follow-up checks

- **Capacity transparency gap:** Many operator pages do not publish explicit desk/office seat counts; most rows therefore show “Not publicly stated.”
- **Address completeness gap:** Several pages emphasize services/programs but omit full location details; where possible, municipal/government listings were used to fill this.
- **Sparse-city verification priority:** Tomar, Beja, Portalegre, Vila Real, and Viana do Castelo should be rechecked directly with operators for current vacancy, pricing, and operating models.
- **Directory contamination risk:** Search results for smaller cities can mix nearby-city venues (e.g., Braga vs Bragança); only city-consistent entries were kept where possible.
- **Suggested follow-up (high value):**
  - Confirm current available inventory and waiting lists by direct contact forms on operator pages.
  - Request current capacity split (private offices vs cowork desks vs meeting rooms) for each shortlisted venue.
  - Validate whether each hub supports company registration/morada fiscal and remote team packages.
- Key follow-up URLs by sparse city:
  - Covilhã: https://www.parkurbis.pt/
  - Tomar: https://www.officio.pt/contato
  - Beja: https://iisba.org/contactos/
